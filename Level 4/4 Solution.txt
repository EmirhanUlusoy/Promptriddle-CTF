In this part, we found a file named "pictures_a.mp3," but since it was a picture file, it should have been in JPG or PNG format. 
We tried PNG, and it worked. Inside, there were numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which seemed to be in a specific order. 
Without forgetting this order, we also tried opening "pictures_b.png," and it opened as another PNG file.

Here, the Morse code alphabet was used. 
By comparing the previous image with this image and arranging them in order, it gave us the "gotcha" password, resulting in success.
