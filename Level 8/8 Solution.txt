In this CTF, we saw 'who.png' in the resources and typed it in. An image of a person appeared. 
We searched for him on Google Images and found out that he is known as the inventor and father of email. 
We entered 'email' in the password field, and it said 'cyber' which we found from the URL. 
The page's title was 'Contact Me', so we clicked on it, and an email form opened. 
We entered our email and username, wrote 'cyber' in the subject, and sent it. When we checked our email, we found out that the password is 'communication'.
