In this part, we looked at the resources and found a file. 
We opened the TXT file, and it appeared on the right side with some strange words. 
After thinking for a while, we realized that the words were written in reverse. 
We assumed that the password was "dessert" and when we typed it, it said "mirror," indicating that we should reverse it again. 
When we reversed it, it became "stressed," and we proceeded to the next level.
